                <p>This journal intensifies the need for the conservation of wildlife. 
                    Eventhough the restricted section of the forest is well under protection, there still exists the 
                    need to prioritise the wildlife in a uplifted manner.Several policies exists in todays world 
                    which enables the society to keep up with this concerning matter. However , this is not 
                    given prime importance.</p>
                <p>Preserving and managing natural habitats is essential for wildlife 
                   conservation. This includes protecting forests, wetlands, grasslands, 
                   and other ecosystems that provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for wildlife.
                   Species Preservation: Conservation efforts focus on safeguarding endangered and 
                   threatened species. This involves measures such as captive breeding, habitat restoration, anti-poaching efforts, and wildlife law enforcement.
                   Sustainable Resource Use: Balancing human needs with conservation
                   goals is important. Promoting sustainable practices for resource
                   extraction, fishing, hunting, and tourism can help minimize the 
                   negative impact on wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
